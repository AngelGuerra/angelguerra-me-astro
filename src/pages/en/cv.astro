              Website of the association La Buena Leche, it has gone through
              several versions, first I made it with <strong>AngularJS</strong> to
              practice, later, being a page that is not updated regularly and has
              no backend, I transformed it to a static page generated with <strong
                >Jekyll</strong
              > and layout with <strong>Bootstrap</strong>. It also had to do
              with the change from AngularJS to Angular, I had to rewrite it all
              over again!

              Website of the Bujinkan Cantabria association, it is made with <strong
                >11ty</strong
              > as site generator and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> as style library.
              Before this there was a page made with WordPress but the person who
              maintained it was no longer going to do it, so I took the baton and
              made it my way. As a curiosity, it is very well positioned in the <ExternalLink

              Website of Regazo Fotograf√≠a, is made with <strong>Hugo</strong> as
              site generator and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> as style library.
              It uses <strong>Netlify</strong> for the resizing of the images and
              the collection of the form data. I made it with Hugo because of my
              eagerness to be always trying new things.

            In addition to what I have commented in all the above, here I am
            going to put other things that at some point I have touched and/or I
            have used to make specific projects to a greater or lesser extent.
            With this I hope to have a small reminder of everything that I have
            been using and that, perhaps, in some future I will use again - or
            not, maybe it also depends on you -.

            Outside the field of technology, I have always liked to do sports,
            especially those that are contact or martial arts. In fact, I have

            Until I was 16 years old I played chess, first occasionally and then
            in tournaments or the Cantabrian league itself. It is a hobby that I
            would like to recover continuously, but at the moment I have parked
            it, although I am always open to play a game.
